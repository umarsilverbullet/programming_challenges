=======================Observation==============================
the situation can have two possiblities to occur
1. Cold Start issue in Serverless machine
2. Timeout.

Mitigation Process
1. Cold Start issue can be resolved in two ways
    a. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events Rule and schedule it to hit every minute to the target ===> Lambda function created for the service product.
    b. Using Vapor , to increase the "warm" value.
2. Timeout issue can be resolved by increasing the timeout at max value.
